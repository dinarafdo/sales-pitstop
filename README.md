# sales-pitstop
A Sales Pitstop is a short, high-impact session designed to refuel, refocus, and re-energize a sales team. Much like a Formula 1 car pulls into the pit for quick optimization, a Sales Pitstop provides sales professionals with the tools, strategies, and motivation needed to boost performance.
